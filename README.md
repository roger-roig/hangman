# Hangman Game

In the game of hangman, the player has to guess one word chosen randomly from a word bank.

The player can choose between a list of different topics (e.g. animals, food, instruments, car brands, capitals, society, hobbies, sports, human body, clothes, etc.).

The computer will then choose a random word from the category that the player has chosen. It will then show the word with underscores to the player.

The computer will then ask the player a letter. The player will have a number of guesses depending on the lenght of the word. 

Depending on whether the player guesses a letter or not, that letter will be undercovered in the word. Otherwise the hangman will start to be drawn. In the case that the player gets all the letters, he wins! Otherwise, if the hangman draw is complete, the game is over!
