Steps:

1 - Create a list of words for each different category
(animals, food, instruments, car brands, capitals, society,
 hobbies, sports, human body, clothes, etc.)

2 - Ask the player to choose a category

3 - Randomly select a word from the chosen category


  Loop over steps 4-8 until word is found or game is over:
  
   4 - Print the word with all the non-guessed characters replaced with underscores
       and the guessed letters undercovered. Also show a list of the letters used so far.
  
   5 - Ask the user for a letter
  
   6 - If the letter is on the list, delete it from the list.
  
   7 - Else, start drawing the hangman. 
       ( I will try for the hangman to be drawn slower or faster depending on the length of the word.)
  

8 - If the list of letters is empty then the user wins the game

9 - If the hangman draw is completed then the game is over

10 - Ask the user if he wants to play another game
